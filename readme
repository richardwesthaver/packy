This is a private crate registry for the Rust programming
language.

The [[https://crates.io][crates.io]] package registry provides a number of excellent crates,
integrates well with the =cargo= development tool, and should be
preferred in all cases. I use =crater= when I need to:
- import my unpublished crates
- import the master branch of a published crate
- import a local or patched version of a published crate
- import a non-git crate (hg)

=crater= also works well in intranet/local environments, and can be
deployed for use in the following ways:
- remote :: same as crates.io, registry index is publicly hosted on GitHub (default)
- local :: registry index is stored locally, crates are retrieved remotely
- static :: registry index and crate sources are stored locally, no
     network requests are required
